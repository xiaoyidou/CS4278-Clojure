# Dinner Decisions

This project will involve using a text messaging interface similar to Uber/Lyft's
auto-reply system for resolving customer complaints to help a user decide which restaurant
to eat based on the user's preferences. The structure of the application will involve the 
text messaging framework we have developed so far. A user will be able to provide the
application with texts of their preferences, representing attributes of restaurants (cheap,
Chinese, no pizza, etc.) and the application will eliminate and prioritize restaurants based
on the labels. From the interviews, several important features will be implemented based on
client needs.

From the interviews, it was discovered that most clients will come up with a decision for 
where to have dinner with their friends. Thus, it would be beneficial to have groups in
this application, where multiple users can have inputs toward the decision. It may also
be interesting to have users within a group weighted differently. It also seems to take quite
a while for people to decide where to eat out, so a need for streamlining this process is
desirable. It is important for the application to follow the usual strategy we do: eliminate
restaurants we don't like and prioritize the ones we do like. It also seems like displaying
a list of restaurants that fit the constraints will get the job done.

Being able to have decision support software in multiple areas of your life is a move toward
the future. If this application is successful, it may be more useful to cache user data and
use historical data for groups to make better suggestions for restaurants. It also may be 
helpful to make a more sophisticated filtering technique that is not so binary (eliminated/not
eliminated). Perhaps machine learning approaches could be used to take in the labels and filter
for restaurants based on the probability it fits the criteria and be trained on the feedback
given after each run.

# Questions:

4.	Do you usually come to a conclusion with other friends or by yourself?
5.	Is the usual strategy to eliminate the places you don’t like first?
6.	Would it be desirable to automate the process of deciding on a meal?
7.	What kind of features would you expect?
8.	Would you be satisfied with something like Uber/Lyft’s automatic messaging system?
9.	Would you be willing to let the app keep a history of your conversations for improving suggestions?
10.	What other aspects of life would you consider “decision making assistance” apps helpful towards?
